# Calc and Converter

This project is a work in progress to mimic Samsung's Calculator app. 
The Samsung calculator app has a much easier and useful user experience. 
This projects aim's to create an iOS version of that app
## How It Was Made

This is a project created using Xcode and SwiftUI. 
The goal is to recreate Samsung's calculator app. Following the MVVM design pattern
and constant reference to Samsung's Calculator app running on a Galaxy device, the app is still a work in progress
## Why It Was Made

Having used Apple's calculator app and Samsung's calculator app, 
Samsung's version is undeniably better. The UI, the colors, the multi-purpose design, even the ability to input
more than one value at a time make this app leagues more valuable to making 
calculations on the go. For those that use iPhone exclusively, there should be an app just
like Samsung's to make simple calculations on the go. 

Another neat trick is its unit converter which can convert a multitude of things such as 
area, length, temperature, volume, mass, and much more. Another feature lacking on Apple's 
native calculator app. For this project, Samsung's calculator app is the inspiration and
you'll notice that the UI is very similar.

## What Needs to Be done

The project is far from completion. Here is a list of features and improvements 
that need to be added.

- Ability to input more than one number at a time into calculator
- UI color improvements
- Landscape and portrait mode compatibility 
- Fix large number issue
- Add more than just length converter (example: add area, mass, volume, speed, etc)
- And more..
